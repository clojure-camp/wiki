# Beginner Programmers

This page collects advice and resource for those new to programming (where Clojure is one of their first programming languages).


## "Crawling"

What is programming? How do computers convert text to behaviour? How do you use Clojure to do anything?

- use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor (with the Calva extension) - you don't even need to install Java, it will set up babashka
- just start with babashka (instead of Clojure proper)

- [ClojureBridge Curriculum](https://clojurebridge.org/curriculum/)
- [Intro to Programming](https://github.com/cognitory/introduction-to-programming/tree/master/chapters) - Raf's WIP book
- http://clojurescriptkoans.com/

- project ideas
  - talk to a mentor to find a project that is interesting to you and appropriate
  - ex
      - drawing with SVGs
      - making a static website
      - doing math?

## "Walking"

How to break down problems? How to make use of the Clojure standard library?
