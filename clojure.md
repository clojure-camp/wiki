# Learning Clojure

- re: editor/IDE, use VSCode + Calva (unless you are already comfortable with emacs or vim)

---

Even if you already know how to program, Clojure may poses a few unique challenges (**highlighted below)**, depending on where you’re coming from.

- learning the syntax and developing a mental model of the Clojure interpreter
  - basic things: defining, using functions; making bindings
  - new things: using macros (ex. →), writing macros
- **functional programming, in the small**
  - ex. “how to sum a list without a mutable variable”, etc.
  - using FP functions (map, reduce, etc.), anonymous functions, higher-order fns (ex. middleware), closures
- becoming aware of all the functions in clojure’s standard library
  - …and libraries in the Clojure community
- **learning to manipulate code comfortably in your editor**
  - ie. becoming comfortable with paredit or parinfer
- **learning to adopt the “REPL-driven workflow”**
  - evaluating code partials in your editor
    - (vs. making a change, re-running an entire script)
- **functional programming, in the large**
  - ie. how to architect a full application with minimal state

…with the goal of eventually doing all these things “idiomatically”, ie, “the way most experienced Clojure devs .
