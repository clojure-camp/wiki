# ☯️ Exercise Site

Curated exercises for learners, [https://exercises.clojure.camp](https://exercises.clojure.camp/)

- exercises are ordered approximately by increasingly complexity/difficulty
- various forms of exercises
  - most are exercism.io like (”write a function to…”), **except**, we also suggest\* what functions to use
    - (with future plans to make further variations, like “fill-in-the-blank”, to make the exercises more accessible to new programmers)

## Students

- attempt solving these exercises in Clojure
- we provide the suggested functions
  - …partly as a hint
  - …and because we don’t expect you to know the entire standard library yet
    - (as you do these exercises, you’ll start to learn and remember which functions are good for what)
