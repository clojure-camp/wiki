# Learning Git

- download a Git GUI
  - it’s particularly useful for visually understanding the state of your repository
  - you will eventually prefer the command-line for most command input (but can use the GUI if it works for you)
  - recommended Git GUIs:
    - SourceTree - free, Mac + Windows
    - GitKraken - free for non-private repos, Mac + Windows + Linux
- instead of `git pull` …
  - do `git fetch` (see the new state of branches in your repo, this is always safe to do),
  - then decide how you want to merge (ex. `git merge --ff`)
