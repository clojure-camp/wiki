# Using ChatGPT and Copilot for Learning

**Should I use ChatGPT for learning?**

Yes, ChatGPT can be a great educational resource. We recommend using it.

It is an infinitely patient mentor, that can answer your exact question any time. But, it sometimes “lies” (aka. gets things wrong), but that’s OK, as long as you’re on guard.

**What about Copilot?**

Sure. But less useful than ChatGPT when starting out. It still requires the judgment to be able to tell whether the code actually does what you want it to do.

## Advice on using Chat GPT

- Errors

  - makes up functions that don’t exist (ex. clojure.core/transpose)
  - mismatches brackets
  - straight up gives wrong answers
    - (”what is nil punning? making a pun about nil values”)

- Ways of using it
  - search engine for appropriate functions
    - “I’d like to do convert a vector of strings to integers in Clojure, what function might I use to do that”
  - code generation
    - “In Clojure, write a function that…”
  - explain code snippet
    - “What does this code do…”
  - explain concept
  - create quiz
    - ex. “You are a computer science expert teaching "Introduction to Clojure" using Clojure for the Brave and True as the course textbook (https://www.braveclojure.com/). Create a quiz to help me determine whether I have mastered Chapter 3, "Do Things" (https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/).”
