- learner guide
    - spaced learning, sleep
    - contributing back

- "social learning" / peer content creation
    - share a bug
    - share explanation of a solution
    - p2p code reviews
        - w/ rubrics

- how to be a good camper
    - things to avoid
        - don't say "just"
        - contempt of other languages, etc.
    - things to do
