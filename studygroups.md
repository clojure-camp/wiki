# Weekly Study Groups

Regular session where multiple learners catch up with one or two mentors to show and tell their progress, get unblocked and create learning accountability.

We start with a show-and-tell of what everyone learned last week, and see where things go from there.

## Groups

## Students…

### Ways to participate

- See the schedule above and pop by an existing group

### Advice\*\*

- nothing is too small to share
- no dumb questions

## Mentors

### Ways to contribute

- Pop by an existing group
  - (see the schedule above)
- Start your own group
  - you should be able to offer 1-2 hours/week, each week
  - it can help to have a second mentor
  - add a new item to [Active Study Groups](#groups) section above
  - also, announce in Discord

### Typical Agenda

- Welcome, check-in round
- Student show-and-tell round
  - One or more of…
    - What i did this week
    - something I learned this week
    - question on my mind
    - something I’m stuck on
  - student and mentor q&a, comments
- Potential Follow On Activities
  - Mentor show & tell
  - Mob-program an exercise
- Closing
  - Feedback round

### Advice for Mentors

- your role is primarily to be a facilitator
  - ie. someone without any Clojure knowledge _could_ facilitate a session (or students could self-facilitate) and it would be fine. Of course, you should leverage your expertise, but, the goal of a session is not to be a lecture.
- the purpose of these check-ins is actually less about “students proving they are working” and more about “students show where they are at, so that the mentor (you) can improvise appropriate content”
  - ie. it’s good to pause / interrupt, go a little deeper in on a topic
    - typically, by asking probing questions that get students discussing, searching for answers
    - or have student modify their code
    - or show / ask for alternative approaches
- if a question comes up, see if a student can answer it first (even if it's always the same one, better they get a chance to explain than you)
  - having to explain a concept in words forces a student to make use of and refine their mental model of the concept

## Pedagogical Intent

- having a place to show something motivates student to work to have something to show
- see other students’ struggles
- commiserate
- learn something new (or become aware of new things to look into)
- the “show and tell” structure is effective at inspiring topics that are relevant and appropriate to where they’re at
