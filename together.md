# 🏫 “Teaching Tech Together” Study Group for Mentors

“How to make Lessons that work and build a teaching community around tech”

> Each chapter ends with a variety of exercises that include a suggested format and how long they usually take to do in person. Most can be used in other formats—in particular, if you are going through this book on your own, you can still do many of the exercises that are intended for groups—and you can always spend more time on them than what’s suggested.
