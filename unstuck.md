# 📞 Unstuck Emergency Hotline

An app to “call for help” when you’re stuck and (maybe) get instant help from a student or mentor.

- Sign up via this link: https://app.unstuckapp.com/join/713e4d7b-a525-418e-9113-cf2c74689cb0
- you can use the browser app, but for better pairing experience (doodling), install the desktop app (it will prompt you after signing in)
- keep it running (you can put it on snooze when you’re busy)

(Fun fact: the Unstuck app was written by [Raf](mentors.md). If you run into issues, complain to him!)
